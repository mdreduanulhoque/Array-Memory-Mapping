🧮 How It Works

Enter total rows (M) and columns (N)

Set Base Address & Data Size

Choose mapping type (Row Major / Column Major)

Click any cell ➜ see formula + step-by-step address calculation

📘 Formula Used
Row Major (C/C++)
Address = Base + ((i × TotalCols) + j) × Size

Column Major (MATLAB-style)
Address = Base + ((j × TotalRows) + i) × Size
